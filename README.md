# Albion-Online-Crafting-Calculator
A project that receives data from the Albion Data Project and converts the data into a useable report on profitability of crafting each item.

# Why this is useful
Albion online has a very complex market system. Everything in the game is made by players, and all resources to make these items are also gathered by players. There are many cities in the game each with their own competitive advantages, and markets in these cities are not connected so logistics play a role in prices.

Essentially there are many factors as to why the Albion market is complicated and volatile. This report will inform you of what items are most profitable, where to craft them, and where to buy the resources from.

When I first made this report in excel powerquery I had to scrape data from Albion2D.com in order to find out how much of x or y resource I needed to make a certain item, as well as other data. Shout out to them for their abundance of data. The only issue being that each item has its own webpage.
